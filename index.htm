				<h2> A little about my hobbies and life story.Get to know me more.</h2>
				<!-- this is the small paragraph of my hobby-->
				<p> Hi guys! Welcome to my page. I grew up on in a small country in Nepal. I grew up in 90s back then we didn't have much internet
					facility in our town. So I just used play outside with my frieds in the mud all day.I remember, I
					used to make a pan using mud and water and I would dry it in the sun. And cook different things in
					that pan using grass and flowers. Since childhood, I always had a passion about cooking. <br />
					As I grew up, I discovered different hobbies and passions in me. </p>

				<h3> How I discovered my hobbies </h3>
				<p> Finding hobbies or passion is not hard. One should not force themselves to like something. If you like it,
					I promise you, you'll know. It's something you enjoy doing. As I already told you how I discovered my cooking
					hobby. So I'll jump to the next one. Blogging!!! This is 2017 and I think its the blogging era. All I see in
					the internet is bloggers and it's actually impressive to see they've managed take talk infront of the camera an
					make money out of it. So one day I was watching this youtuber called Michelle Phan, the makeup Guru. She uploads her everyday
					vlogs, makeup tutorials, life hacks and so on on her blog and youtube channel.I decided to vlog too. And I liked it. 
					Its fun. Since then I have started blogging whenever I have leisure time.  </p>
